at first I start with HTML file, I applied the 6 engine and the two buttons, 
and I have added a welcoming word in the top of the page.
after that I start using css, first thing was adding the picture, then after 
that modifying the text and makes it look prettier.
and try my best to do color matching.
after that I work in the database, the table i created consist of 7 column, 
6 columns for the engine,
the last column to indicate the state of the engines, which means whether they
 are on save mode or on play mode.
then finally I I made a php page and link the user Interface with the database I created.
and also, I make sure that the data being inserted to the database, otherwise it 
will show a message that the data could not added to the database.


(IMPORTANT NOTES):
then you have to put this file in 'htdocs' inside the XAMPP folders.
how to run? go to the browser , then type 'localhost' followed by the port number , ex:1234 ,then the folder name 
Example:localhost:1234/Tasks/

now you can rotate the engines and send the data to the database.

also note that in the video I recorded, I show the user interface and i SAVE the data and show it to you after it is being 
inserted to the database and it has '0' in its status.
And when I try again with different data and push the PLAY button, data will be stored also and the status will contain '1'.
